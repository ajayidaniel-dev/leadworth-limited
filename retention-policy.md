Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a uniform standard for data retention at LWC.
We strive to retain data strictly for the duration necessary to satisfy the objectives for
which it was originally obtained. Upon the expiration of the required retention period,
LWC’s protocol requires the complete erasure of such data. These guidelines are to be
strictly adhered to by all organizational units to ensure regulatory compliance and
operational integrity.
Scope
This policy encompasses all data collected by LWC and stored on company-owned or
leased systems and media, irrespective of geographic location. It applies to all formats,
including electronic records (such as photographs, video, and audio recordings) and
physical hard-copy files. Retention requirements are governed by the Nigeria Data
Protection Act (NDPA) 2023, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and
defined legitimate business interests.
Reasons for Data Retention
LWC maintains only the data essential for its operational efficiency, the fulfillment of its
mission, and strict adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.
LWC maintains data for the following legitimate purposes:

1. Service Delivery &amp; Stakeholder Engagement: To facilitate ongoing services for
   data subjects, including the distribution of newsletters and program updates,
   administration of training programs, and the processing of payroll and employee
   benefits.
2. Statutory &amp; Financial Compliance: To adhere to legal requirements concerning
   financial reporting to shareholders and the submission of mandatory disclosures
   to regulatory agencies for the maintenance of business licenses and permits.
3. Legal &amp; Administrative Obligations: To ensure compliance with applicable labor,
   taxation, and immigration laws.
4. Regulatory Adherence: To satisfy other industry-specific or governmental
   regulatory requirements.
5. Security &amp; Risk Management: To support security incident investigations or other
   internal and external forensic inquiries.
6. Asset &amp; Legal Protection: To facilitate the preservation of intellectual property
   and the management of active or anticipated litigation.

Data Duplication
LWC prioritizes the elimination of redundant data storage to optimize system efficiency
and security. While the organization endeavors to avoid duplication, multiple copies may
be maintained where justified by operational necessity or specific business
requirements. Regardless of the number of iterations or storage locations, this policy
applies universally to all data in LWC’s possession, including all backup and duplicate
copies.

    Data Destruction
    To ensure responsible data management, LWC mandates the active destruction of data
    once its retention period has lapsed. Employees who believe certain information
    warrants further retention for business reasons must report this to their supervisor with
    a formal justification. All policy exceptions are subject to approval by the Data
    Protection Officer and legal counsel. Furthermore, a litigation hold may be implemented
    by the legal department in rare instances, overriding standard destruction protocols to
    preserve evidence for legal matters.
